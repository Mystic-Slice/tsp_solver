# Travelling Salesman Problem Solver

Searches for the best path using a genetic algorithm and two-opt search.

## To run:
```py
python3 run.py <path-to-map-file>
```

Runs and plots the best path identified. Stores the plots in `pathplots` directory.

`cargo run <path-to-map-file>` -> to only find the best path. The resultant path can be found in `<algorithm>.txt` in root.
